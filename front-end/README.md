This project was inspired by the Wordle game at https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/

This is purely an excersice to build knowledge of React.

The game is fully functional, however requires 2 people. One person to pick the word and the other to guess.
There is currently no validation of what is a current word and what is not.

Once a back-end server is created, it will host a small database of game links and the corresponding word so it can be shared online. This will also open up the ability to get a random word from the server to play yourself.


This can be ran using **npm start**
